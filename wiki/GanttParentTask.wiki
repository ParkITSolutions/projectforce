1. Select the task you want to be the child.

2. Click on edit button. A Edit Task overlay shows up.

3. Click on Parent icon, next to the parent field.

The right identation works only for one task, if you want to make one task parent of many tasks, you have to do the step one for all the tasks you want to be childs.
